/* A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax for this is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.
A sample loop will be

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
Input Format

You will be given two positive integers,  and  (), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer  in the interval  :

If , then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for , "two" for , and so on.
Else if  and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if  and it is an odd number, then print "odd".
Note: 

Sample Input

8
11
Sample Output

eight
nine
even
odd

    cin>>a; // read in value a
    cin>>b; // read in value b
    for(i=a;i<=b;i++) //i++ keeping it continued rather stopping until the condition is made
    {   // for loop to iterate through the for to print out the right "i"
        if(i<=9)
        {
            cout<<str[i-1]<<"\n";  // [i-1] for the array since it starts at zero
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<str[9+(i%2)]<<"\n";  // [9+(i%2)] would result in either zero or 1 making it even or odd
        }
